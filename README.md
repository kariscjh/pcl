## Sudden thought
Reading this post might mean you are thinking of quitting your job or trying to get another job.

Because I have same thinking with you, while having many thoughts, I write some thoughts down for sharing.

***
## What is job?
Maybe jobs mean people buy my effort so we can earn money as a result.

But the effort should be something I feel good or I feel interested or I feel it is rewarding.

However, my present effort getting paid is not like that.

The reasons why I want to quit my job or move to another one but I feel it is hard are like these.

1. I feel I develop myself,
2. I feel it is rewarding,
3. I feel interested. That is the 1st reason,

2nd, I am getting well paid for my effort now because it is big company as more than I have actually,

3rd, I don’t know what people will look at my effort worthy. Shortly, I don’t know if I can MOVE to another company. And maybe I can’t because I don’t have enough skills.

***I get those thoughts***
